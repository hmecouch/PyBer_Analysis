# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
  ### Purpose
  The purpose for this new analysis was to create a visualization for the total weekly fares for each city type and use it to summarize how the data differs by city   type. 
  ### End Goal
  We can use our summary of the data to advise PyBer decision-makers on what steps they can take to increase profits for the company.

 ## Results 
  ### Summary Dataframe
  The picture here is of the dataframe I created to show fare data from each type of city.

  With this information we can see that the urban cities use pyber far more than the other two cities types. This makes sense because urban cities are far more populated than the other two. The same can be said for the suburban vs rural. Another thing to notice is the average fares for rural areas are the highest ($10 more than urban and $4 more than suburban).
  ### Line Chart
  The second visualization I made for this analysis was a multiple-line chart showing each city types fare totals for each week.

  Here we can get a glimpse of how the total fares correlate to the date. An interesting thing to notice in the chart is a big dip in the beginning of February and a   big spike towards the end of February for all three city types.
